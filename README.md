Welcome,

This is the Code Institute student template for deploying your third portfolio project, the Python command-line project. The last update to this file was: **May 14, 2024**

## Reminders

- Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
- Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
- Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.

Happy coding!



# It Is Practice Time

It Is Practice Time is a Python terminal app for musicians that utilizes spaced repetition to assist in learning new pieces as well as maintaining an already existing repertoire.

In order to achieve that the app takes care of tracking the progress on a previously added piece through user input, uses that progress to calculate the next time the piece should be practiced and thus automatically suggests what to practice in a given practice session.

Thereby it not only relieves the musician from figuring out what to practice next, which can be time consuming especially if the repertoire increases to a large number of pieces, but also from keeping track of the progress manually. Furthermore it gives her/him the peace of mind that no piece will be forgotten and it will be suggested for practice when the time comes.

All this leads to a more enjoyable practice experience since it streamlines the process by taking care of some of the "book keeping" and decision making and thus helps the musician to focus on the most important part of a practice session: to play music.
